Hello, my name is Zack Larsen. I am fun, easy going, and athletic. 
This last summer I built the courage to try something new and found myself canyoneering in Zion. Me and my friends did three routes with multiple repels including the 90ft free fall. 
My favorite animal is a dog. Growing up, I always asked my parents for two dogs and return received countless amounts of stuff animals. Still waiting for the right time to get a pooch.

When I was 18 years old I joined the navy
Ive been on 3 deployments
Now, I built my dream house on the beach
And got a dog. 

I want to add more about my family
I am the third of four children
My mom is Brenda and dad is Todd
I have two older brothers and one little sister
They are all married.
